> NOTE: If you find yourself in some trouble going through this, reach out to us directly on our [What's app Group][whats-app-group].

### Prerequisites

1. **NodeJS:** <br>
   Please install [NodeJS >= 10.15.0](https://nodejs.org/en/download/). If you already have it, you're good to go.

1. **Yarn:** <br>
   Visit [Yarn download page](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install). Select your Operating system and follow the instructions.

<!-- 1. **EditorConfig:** <br>
   Please visit [EditorConfig](https://editorconfig.org/) -> `Download a Plugin` section and scroll through to see if you need to install an additional Plugin/Extension for your code editor or IDE. If your IDE needs one, you should find a link to that plugin/extension on that page.

   This prerequisite is directly related to [`.editorconfig`][repo-link/blob/develop/.editorconfig] in the root directory of this project.

   **_More About EditorConfig:_** <br>
   EditorConfig helps maintain consistent coding styles for multiple developers working on the same project across various editors and IDEs. The EditorConfig project consists of a file format for defining coding styles and a collection of text editor plugins that enable editors to read the file format and adhere to defined styles. EditorConfig files are easily readable, and they work nicely with version control systems.
